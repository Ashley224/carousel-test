# Carousel Test [![Build Status](https://github.com/Ashley224/carousel-test)]


## Quick Overview

Carousel Test is React based responsive Carousel powered by BootStrap.

### Get Started Immediately

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them
Install Npm and Node and Yarn
https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

* Open command prompt inside folder
* Type yarn add
* After completion type npm start

Inside that directory, it will generate the initial project structure and install the transitive dependencies:

```
my-app
├── README.md
├── node_modules
├── package.json
├── .gitignore
├── public
│   ├── favicon.ico
│   ├── index.html
│   └── manifest.json
└── src
    ├── containers/
    ├── components/
    ├── core/
        ├── services/
        ├── constants.js
    ├── assets/
        ├── css/
        ├── images/
    ├── App.js
    ├── App.test.js
    ├── index.css
    ├── index.js
    ├── logo.svg
    └── serviceWorker.js
```

No configuration or complicated folder structures, just the files you need to build your app.<br>
Once the installation is done, you can open your project folder:

```sh
cd my-app
```

Inside the newly created project, you can run some built-in commands:

### `npm start` or `yarn start`

Runs the app in development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will automatically reload if you make changes to the code.<br>
You will see the build errors and lint warnings in the console.

### `npm run build` or `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>

Your app is ready to be deployed.
